# Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.

Input: Root of below tree  

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6  
See below diagram for another example. 1+2+3

For each node there can be four ways that the max path goes through the node:
1. Node only
2. Max path through Left Child + Node
3. Max path through Right Child + Node
4. Max path through Left Child + Node + Max path through Right Child
