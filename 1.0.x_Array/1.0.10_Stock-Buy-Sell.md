# Stock Buy Sell to Maximize Profit

he cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days.  

For example, if the given array is {100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695}, the maximum profit can earned by buying on day 0, selling on day 3. Again buy on day 4 and sell on day 6. If the given array of prices is sorted in decreasing order, then profit cannot be earned at all.

```
class Interval {
    int buy, sell;
}

class StockBuySell {
    void stockBuySell(int[] price, int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return;
        }

        int count;

        ArrayList<Interval> sol = new ArrayList<Interval>();

        int i = 0;
        while (i < n-1) {
            // Find local min
            while ((i < n-1) && (price[i+1] <= price[i])) {
                i++;
            }

            if (i == n-1) {
                break;
            }

            Interval e = new Interval();
            e.buy = i++;

            // Find lcoal max
            while((i < n-1) && (price[i+1] >= price[i])) {
                i++;
            }

            e.sell = i++;
            sol.add(e);

            count++;
        }

        if (count == 0) {
            System.out.println("There is no day when buying the stock " + "will make profit");
        } else {
            for (int j = 0; j < count; j++) {
                System.out.println("Buy on day: " + sol.get(j).buy  + " " + "Sell on day : " + sol.get(j).sell);
            }
        }

        return;
    }
}
