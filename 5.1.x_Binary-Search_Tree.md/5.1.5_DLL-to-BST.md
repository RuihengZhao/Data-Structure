# In-place conversion of Sorted DLL to Balanced BST

Given a Doubly Linked List which has data members sorted in ascending order. Construct a Balanced Binary Search Tree which has same data members as the given Doubly Linked List.\

Method1:
1) Get the Middle of the linked list and make it root.
2) Recursively do same for left half and right half.  
       a) Get the middle of left half and make it left child of the root
          created in step 1.  
       b) Get the middle of right half and make it right child of the
          root created in step 1.

Method2:  
We first count the number of nodes in the given Linked List. Let the count be n. After counting nodes, we take left n/2 nodes and recursively construct the left subtree. After left subtree is constructed, we assign middle node to root and link the left subtree with root. Finally, we recursively construct the right subtree and link it with root.

```
class LinkedList {
    Node head;

    Node sortedListToBST() {
        int n = countNodes(head);
        return sortedListToBSTRecur(n);
    }

    Node sortedListToBSTRecur(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return null;

        Node left = sortedListToBSTRecur(n/2);

        Node root = head;
        root.prev = left;

        head = head.next;

        root.next = sortedListToBSTRecur(n- n/2 - 1);
        return root;
    }

    int countNodes(Node head) {
        int count = 0;
        Node temp = head;
        while (temp != null) {
            temp = temp.next;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
