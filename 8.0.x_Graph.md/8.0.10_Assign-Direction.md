# Assign directions to edges so that the directed graph remains acyclic

Given a graph with both directed and undirected edges. It is given that the directed edges donâ€™t form cycle. How to assign directions to undirected edges so that the graph (with all directed edges) remains acyclic even after the assignment?

Use Topological Sorting
- only consider directed edges and find topological sorting.
- for every undirected edge(u, v), assign its diection from u to v if u comes before v in sorting
