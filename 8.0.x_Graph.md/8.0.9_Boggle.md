# Boggle (Find all possible words in a board of characters)

Given a dictionary, a method to do lookup in dictionary and a M x N board where every cell has one character. Find all possible words that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent characters. Note that we can move to any of 8 adjacent characters, but a word should not have multiple instances of same cell.

**Input:** dictionary[] = {"GEEKS", "FOR", "QUIZ", "GO"};  
       boggle[][]   = {{'G','I','Z'}, {'U','E','K'}, {'Q','S','E'}};  
       isWord(str): returns true if str is present in dictionary else false.  

**Output:** Following words of dictionary are present GEEKS QUIZ

The idea is to consider every character as a starting character and find all words starting with it. All words starting from a character can be found using Depth First Traversal(DFS). We do depth first traversal starting from every cell. We keep track of visited cells to make sure that a cell is considered only once in a word.
