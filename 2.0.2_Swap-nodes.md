# Swap nodes in a linked list without swapping data

Given a linked list and two keys in it, swap nodes for two given keys. Nodes should be swapped by changing links. Swapping data of nodes may be expensive in many situations when data contains many fields.

```
class LinkedList {
    Node head;

    public void swapNodes(int x, int y) {
        if (x == y) return;

        Node prevX = null, currX = head;
        while (currX != null && currX.data != x) {
            prevX = currX;
            currX = currX.next();
        }

        Node prevY = null, currY = head;
        while (currY != null && currY.data != y) {
            prevY = currY;
            currY = currY.next();
        }

        if (currX == null || currY == null) return;

        if (prevX == null) {
            head= currY;
        } else {
            prevX.next = currY;
        }

        if (prevY == null) {
            head = currX;
        } else {
            prevY.next = currX;
        }

        Node temp = currX.next;
        currX.next = currY.next;
        currY.next = temp
    }
}
