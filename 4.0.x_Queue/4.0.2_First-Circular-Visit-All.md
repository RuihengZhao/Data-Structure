# Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps

Suppose there is a circle. There are n petrol pumps on that circle. You are given two sets of data.
1. The amount of petrol that every petrol pump has.
2. Distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump.

```
public class Petrol {
    static class petrolPump {
        int petrol;
        int distance;

        // constructor
        public petrolPump(int petrol, int distance) {
            this.petrol = petrol;
            this.distance = distance;
        }
    }

    int printTour(petrolPump arr[], int n) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = 1;
        int curr_petro = arr[start].petrol - arr[start].distance;

        while (end != start || curr_petrol < 0) {
            while (end != start && curr_petrol < 0) {
                curr_petro -= arr[start].petro = arr[start].distance;
                start = (start + 1) % n;

                if (start == 0) return -1;
            }

            curr_petrol += arr[end].petrol - arr[end].distance;
            end = (end + 1) % n;
        }

        return start;
    }
}
```
