# Threaded Binary Tree

A binary tree is made threaded by making all right child pointers that would normally be NULL point to the inorder successor of the node (if it exists).

The idea of threaded binary trees is to make inorder traversal faster and do it without stack and without recursion.

There are two types of threaded binary trees.  
**Single Threaded:** Where a NULL right pointers is made to point to the inorder successor (if successor exists)

**Double Threaded:** Where both left and right NULL pointers are made to point to inorder predecessor and inorder successor respectively. The predecessor threads are useful for reverse inorder traversal and postorder traversal.

```
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;
    boolean rightThread; // indicate whether right pointer points to right child or inorder successor
}
```
